# React Router functionality

## ü¶â Main information

Create React App doesn't include page routing. React Router is the most popular solution.

React Router is a JavaScript framework that lets us handle client and server-side routing in React applications. It enables the creation of single-page web or mobile apps that allow navigating without refreshing the page. It also allows us to use browser history features while preserving the right application view.
